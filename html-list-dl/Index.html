		    25 December 1876 – 11 September 1948) was a barrister, politician and the founder of Pakistan.[1] Jinnah served as the leader of the All-India Muslim 
			League from 1913 until the inception of Pakistan on 14 August 1947, and then as the Dominion of Pakistan's first governor-general until his death.

		    Jinnah's given name at birth was Mahomedali Jinnahbhai,[a] and he likely was born in 1876,[b] to Jinnahbhai Poonja and his wife Mithibai
	        , in a rented apartment on the second floor of Wazir Mansion near Karachi,[2] now in Sindh, Pakistan but then within the Bombay Presidency of British India.
	        Jinnah's paternal grandfather was from Paneli Moti village in Gondal state in Kathiawar peninsula (now in Gujarat, India).

		    In 1892, Sir Frederick Leigh Croft, a business associate of Jinnahbhai Poonja, offered young Jinnah a London apprenticeship with his firm,
			Graham's Shipping and Trading Company.[23] He accepted the position despite the opposition of his mother, who before he left, had him enter an 
			arranged marriage with his cousin, two years his junior from the ancestral village of Paneli, Emibai Jinnah. Jinnah's mother and first wife both 
			died during his absence in England.[24] Although the apprenticeship in London was considered a great opportunity for Jinnah, one reason for sending
			him overseas was a legal proceeding against his father, which placed the family's property at risk of being sequestered by the court. In 1893, 
			the Jinnahbhai family moved to Bombay
